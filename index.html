            <h2>Things to Do</h2>
            <p>Dev Deepavali, also known as the "Festival of Lights of the Gods," is celebrated primarily in Varanasi and other parts of India. It falls 15 days after Diwali, on the full moon of the Hindu month of Kartika, and marks the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and the worship of the gods, particularly Lord Shiva. It is a time for spiritual reflection and devotion.</p>
    
            <h3>Here are some things you can do to celebrate the auspicious occasion of Dev Deepavali:</h3>
            <ol class="activity-list">
                <li><strong>Take a Ritual Bath</strong>: On this day, people should take a ritual bath, especially in holy rivers like the Ganges, to purify themselves. This ritual bath should be conducted within an hour of sunrise which is at 6:15 AM on the 15th November 2024. This bath if not done in the Ganges must be done at your own dwelling place but within 7:15 AM, which is within 1 hour after sunrise.</li>
    
                <li><strong>Offer Prayers and Pujas after the ritual bath</strong>: Devotees often visit temples, especially ones dedicated to Lord Shiva, and participate in special pujas (rituals) to seek blessings for prosperity, health, and spiritual growth. If you're at home, you must perform a puja with offerings of flowers, incense, light and perform a bhajan yourself.</li>
    
                <li><strong>Create a Clean and Sacred Environment</strong>: Just like Diwali, Dev Deepavali involves cleaning and decorating your home. You can draw rangolis (traditional floor art) and adorn your house with beautiful lights to create an atmosphere of joy and positivity immediately after offering prayers to Shiva.</li>
    
                <li><strong>Light Diyas (Oil Lamps)</strong>: Light diyas or oil lamps around your home or temple. These symbolize the removal of darkness and ignorance, bringing light into your life. If you’re near a river or water body, float diyas on the water, as it is a common practice during Dev Deepavali, particularly in Varanasi.</li>
    
                <li><strong>Engage in Bhajans and Kirtans</strong>: Devotional songs and chants are an integral part of the celebration. You can participate in or listen to bhajans and kirtans dedicated to Lord Shiva and other deities. It’s a way to immerse yourself in the spiritual essence of the occasion.</li>
    
                <li><strong>Reflect and Meditate</strong>: Dev Deepavali is also a time for introspection and spiritual awakening. Take some time to meditate and reflect on your inner self, seek forgiveness for past mistakes, and set positive intentions for the future.</li>
    
                <li><strong>Feed the Needy</strong>: In keeping with the spirit of compassion, you can also perform acts of charity, such as feeding the less fortunate or donating to those in need.</li>
    
                <li><strong>Enjoy Traditional Sweets and Food</strong>: Like Diwali, Dev Deepavali is a time for festive meals. Prepare and share traditional sweets and dishes with family and friends, as sharing food is a way to spread happiness and good fortune.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>By focusing on devotion, light, and inner peace, Dev Deepavali offers a chance to connect with the divine and celebrate the triumph of righteousness.</p>
